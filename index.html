    <h1>Dear Lottery vs Nagaland Lottery – What is the Difference?</h1>

    <p>Most of the individuals in India listen to Dear Lottery and Nagaland Lottery and believe that these are two lotteries.
    In reality, they are the same. The only distinction is in the name.</p>

    <h2>1. Who runs them</h2>
    <p>The official state lottery is Nagaland Lottery in which the Government of Nagaland takes part.
    Just the brand name of the lottery tickets sold by the Nagaland government is Dear Lottery.</p>

    <p><strong>So:</strong><br>
    Nagaland Lottery = the state apparatus.<br>
    Dear Lottery = the name of such a system.</p>

    <h2>2. Draw timings</h2>
    <p>In both names, the daily draws are denoted:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1:00 PM – Dear Morning Draw</li>
      <li>6:00 PM – Dear Day Draw</li>
      <li>8:00 PM – Dear Night Draw</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are all draws which are conducted under Nagaland State Lottery.</p>

    <h2>3. Ticket price and prizes</h2>
    <p>Ticket price: ₹6</p>
    <p>First prize: ₹1 Crore</p>
    <p>Other prizes: 9,000 rupees, 500 rupees, 250 rupees, 120 rupees and in some cases, 1,000 rupees consolation prize.</p>
    <p>By purchasing a Dear Lottery ticket, you are purchasing a Nagaland Lottery ticket with a Dear brand.</p>
